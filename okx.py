"""Minimal OKX REST client with demo/live switch.

All demo requests automatically include the header ``x-simulated-trading: 1``
while live requests omit it.  OKX funding calculations clamp rates between a
cap and floor as described in the official documentation.  OKX have announced
that the formula may change (e.g. the historical 8â€‘hour sample), therefore the
implementation keeps the logic minimal and documents this behaviour here.
